        <td><b>Pharming</b> - involves modifying DNS entries (local by changing the hosts file or DNS server), which causes users to be directed to the wrong website when they visit a certain web address.  The aim is to capture user login credentials. To change local DNS, attackers  install malware.  Attackers take advantage of exploits in software that control DNS servers.

        <td><b>IP spoofing</b> - creating IP packets with false source IP address for the purpose of impersonating another computer.  IP address spoofing is most frequently used in denial-of-service attacks, where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack</td>

Rootkit is a collection of software tools that enables remote control and administration-level access over a computer or computer networks. Once remote access is obtained, the rootkit can perform a number of malicious actions; they come equipped with keyloggers, password stealers and antivirus disablers.
